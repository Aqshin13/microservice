# Microservice-Based Application

This project represents a microservice-based architecture where multiple independent services work together to deliver a comprehensive solution. The application includes **user authentication**, **user management**, **email notifications**, and **service discovery** as core features.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Architecture Overview

The project includes the following main microservices and components:

- **API Gateway**  
  The main entry point that handles all external requests, routes them to the appropriate service, and enforces security policies.

- **Eureka Service**  
  A service registry and discovery server that allows microservices to find each other.

- **Auth Service**  
  Manages user authentication and account activation workflows. Produces events for email notifications via Kafka.

- **User Service**  
  Manages user information.

- **Share Service**  
  (Manages shares of user.)

- **Email Service**  
  Consumes events from Kafka produced by the Auth Service and sends activation or notification emails to users.
